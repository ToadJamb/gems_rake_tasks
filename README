== Welcome to RakeTasks

RakeTasks provides basic rake tasks, such as rdoc generation,
building and installing gems, and running tests. It will also load additional
rake tasks if they are found.

The following assumptions are currently made:

1. There is a valid .gemspec file in the root folder that is named the same
   as the root folder.

2. Tests reside in a folder named 'test' and test files are named *_test.rb.

3. Additional rake tasks are named *.rb and reside in a folder named 'tasks'.

== Getting Started

1. Install RakeTasks at the command prompt if you haven't yet:

    gem install rake_tasks

2. Require the gem in your gemfile:

    gem 'rake_tasks', '~> 0.0.1'

3. Require the gem wherever you need state management:

    require 'rake_tasks'
