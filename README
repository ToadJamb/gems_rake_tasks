== Welcome to RakeTasks

RakeTasks provides basic rake tasks for generating documentation,
building and installing gems, and running tests.
It will also load additional rake tasks if they are in a folder named 'tasks'.
mmmm yummy

The following assumptions are currently made:

1. There is a valid .gemspec file in the root folder that is named the same
   as the root folder.

2. Tests reside in a folder named 'test' and test files are named *_test.rb.

3. Additional rake tasks are named *.rb and reside in a folder named 'tasks'.

The default task will be set in the following order:

1. If tests are found, rake will run test:all.

2. If tests are not found, but an appropriately named .gemspec file is,
   gem:build will be run.

3. If no tests or .gemspec are found, rdoc:app will be run.

== Getting Started

1. Install RakeTasks at the command prompt if you haven't yet:

    gem install rake_tasks

2. Require the gem in your Gemfile:

    gem 'rake_tasks', '~> 0.0.4'

3. Require the gem wherever you need to use it:

    require 'rake_tasks'

== Additional Documentation

 rake rdoc:app
